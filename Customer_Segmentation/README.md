# Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

This project groups customers based on their Annual Income and Spending Score using the K-Means Clustering algorithm. The aim is to identify distinct customer segments for targeted marketing.

## Dataset

- **Source**: [Mall Customers Dataset – Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation-tutorial)
- **Features used**:  
  - Annual Income (k$)  
  - Spending Score (1–100)

## Tools & Libraries

- Python  
- Google Colab  
- NumPy  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- scikit-learn

## Steps Followed

1. Data loading and exploration  
2. Feature selection  
3. Elbow Method to find optimal clusters  
4. Model training using `KMeans`  
5. Cluster prediction and visualization

## Output

- Five distinct customer clusters visualized using scatter plots  
- Clear groupings based on income and spending patterns
